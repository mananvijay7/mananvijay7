# ðŸ‘‹ About Me:

<br>ðŸŽ“ I'm currently pursuing an MS in Computer Software Engineering from Northeastern University, Boston. My aim is to give my best in whatever I'm doing. I love being in the tech industry, and I'm always in awe of how it is evolving continuously. I like building new things and solving problems. I have done my undergrad in CS, a couple of internships at startups, and 2 years of experience as a Software Engineer for India's top Bank organization. I'm good with MERN stack, NextJS, Java, Salesforce, AWS, Problem-Solving, and Agile. Check out my projects and Collaborations.
